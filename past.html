Lake Baikal region of Siberia. One Upper Paleolithic genome shares
the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native

monkey gut microbiomes demonstrates the importance of human ecology
over phylogeny. Presenter: Katie Amato.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are
more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World
monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes." The
microbiomes of humans are also more variable than those of other
primates.</li>

<ul>
<li>X chromosomes and autosomes have different levels of genetic
diversity because of their different population
sizes. Furthermore, they respond differently to changes in
population size, even in the absence of differences in male and
female effective population sizes. These authors present a new
method that simultaneously estimates changes in population size
and in the ratio of male to female effective sizes. Finally, they
apply the new method to several human populations.</li>

Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related
hominin. Presenter: Alan Rogers</p>

<ul>
<li>"We show that early in the middle Pleistocene, long before the
expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, the 'neandersovan'
ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans undertook a very similar
expansion. In both cases, an African population expanded into
Eurasia, endured a narrow bottleneck of population size, interbred
with indigeneous Eurasians, largely replaced them, and split into
eastern and western sub-populations. In the earlier expansion,
neandersovans interbred with a 'superarchaic' population that had
been separate since about 2 mya and may represent the original
expansion of humans into Eurasia."</li>

Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains. Presenter:
Benjamin Peter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Studies gene flow between Neanderthals and Denisovans using a new
method that can cope with degraded, low-coverage, DNA. Finds
evidence of gene flow in both directions over a long period of
time. But only in the Altai region of Siberia. European
Neanderthals show no evidence of Denisovan admixture.</li>
