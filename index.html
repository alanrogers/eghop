<h1>Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet by Zoom <em>every Monday at 1 PM
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain time</a></em>.</p>

<p>Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do this will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
(<a href="mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu">rogers@anthro.utah.edu</a>). Unless we
know you already, tell us about yourself. We'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.</p>

<h2>Suggested readings</h2>

<p>Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-CnDFiBVV5Zw_SR-CrBe5zYSijwkM1aiIqKeDjeQX2eRQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link</a> to suggest articles for discussion. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings. To see the current list of
suggested readings, click <a href="suggested.html">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jul 27 <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.127555v1">Cole et al. 2020.</a> Ancient admixture into
Africa from the ancestors of non-Africans. Presenter: Chris Cole. </p>

<ul>
<li>"Here we present SMCSMC, a Bayesian method for inference of
time-varying population sizes and directional migration rates
under the coalescent-with-recombination model, to study ancient
demographic events. We find evidence for substantial migration
from the ancestors of present-day Eurasians into African groups
between 40 and 70 thousand years ago, predating the divergence of
Eastern and Western Eurasian lineages. This event accounts for
previously unexplained genetic diversity in African populations,
and supports the existence of novel population substructure in the
Late Middle Paleolithic."</li>

<li><p>Aug 03 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2">Ioannidis et al. 2020</a> Native American gene flow
into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia." </li>
