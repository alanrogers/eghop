<h1>Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet weekly by Zoom. We have not yet
decided on a time for the Spring semester of 2021.
<!--
During the Fall
semester of 2020, we'll meet Mondays at noon
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain time</a>.--></p>

<p>Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do so will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
(<a href="mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu">rogers@anthro.utah.edu</a>). Unless I
know you already, tell me about yourself. I'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.</p>

<h2>Suggested readings</h2>

<p>Click <a href="suggested.html">here</a> for the list of readings that have been
suggested for future meetings of the journal club. Use
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-CnDFiBVV5Zw_SR-CrBe5zYSijwkM1aiIqKeDjeQX2eRQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link</a> to suggest an article or preprint yourself. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings.</p>
