<h1>Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet by Zoom every Monday from 1-2 PM
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain time</a>.</p>

<p>Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do so will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
(<a href="mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu">rogers@anthro.utah.edu</a>). Unless I
know you already, tell me about yourself. I'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.</p>

<h2>Suggested readings</h2>

<p>Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-CnDFiBVV5Zw_SR-CrBe5zYSijwkM1aiIqKeDjeQX2eRQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link</a> to suggest articles for discussion. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings. To see the current list of
suggested readings, click <a href="suggested.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Aug 03 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2">Ioannidis et al. 2020</a> Native American gene flow
into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement. Presenter: Alan
Rogers.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia." </li>

<li><p>Aug 10 <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaaz0183.abstract">Wang et al. 2020.</a> Ancient genomes reveal complex
patterns of population movement, interaction, and replacement in
sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here, we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan
African individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from
the DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the
contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer
populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with
incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic
environments. ... In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry
post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting
an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa."</li>
