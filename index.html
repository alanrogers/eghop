<h1>Evolutionary genetics of humans and other primates: a journal club</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet by Zoom <em>every Monday at 1 PM
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain time</a></em>.</p>

<p>Each week, we'll discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do this will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
(rogers@anthro.utah.edu). Unless we know you already, tell us about
yourself. We'll send you the Zoom meeting id and password.</p>

<h2>Suggested readings</h2>

<p>Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-CnDFiBVV5Zw_SR-CrBe5zYSijwkM1aiIqKeDjeQX2eRQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link</a> to suggest articles for discussion. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings.</p>

reintroduced functional ancestral alleles lost in Eurasian
populations.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Our study reveals that Neanderthal introgression reintroduced
thousands of lost ancestral variants with gene regulatory activity
and that these RAs [reintroduced alleles] were more tolerated than
NDAs [Neanderthal-derived allelees]. Thus, RAs and their distinct
evolutionary histories must be considered when evaluating the
effects of introgression."</li>

into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia." </li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0897-7">Betti et al. 2020</a> Climate shaped how Neolithic
farmers and European hunter-gatherers interacted after a major
slowdown from 6,100 BCE to 4,500 BCE.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We identify four axes of [European Neolithic] expansion and
observe a slowdown along three axes when crossing the same
climatic threshold. This threshold reflects the quality of the
growing season, suggesting that Near Eastern crops might have
struggled under more challenging climatic conditions. This same
threshold also predicts the mixing of farmers and hunter-gatherers
as estimated from ancient DNA, suggesting that unreliable yields
in these regions might have favoured the contact between the two
groups."</li>

factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neandertals.</p>

<ul>
<li>"A recent genetic association study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020)
identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for
respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2. Recent data comprising 3,199
hospitalized COVID-19 patients and controls reproduce this and
find that it is the major genetic risk factor for severe
SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (COVID-19 Host Genetics
Initiative). Here, we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic
segment of ~50 kb that is inherited from Neandertals and occurs at
a frequency of ~30% in south Asia and ~8% in Europe."</li>

<ul>
<li>Studied 42 late-Neolithic genomes from the Wartenberg culture of
Europe. A high percentage--40%--of their ancestry was from hunter
gatherers, and their HLA alleles were unlike those of modern
Europeans. The authors argue that their immune systems were

<ul>
<li>"We use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the
demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral
population and estimate that at least 20% of nonsynonymous
substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by
positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous
estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup
species and ancestral population."</li>

Receptor.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The gene encoding the progesterone receptor (PGR) carries
introgressed Neandertal haplotypes...[, which] have reached nearly
20% frequency in non-Africans and have been associated with
preterm birth...  Present-day carriers of the Neandertal
haplotypes express higher levels of the receptor. In a cohort of
present-day Britons, these carriers have more siblings, fewer
miscarriages, and less bleeding during early pregnancy suggesting
that the Neandertal progesterone receptor alleles promote
fertility. This may explain their high frequency in modern human
populations."</li>

<ul>
<li>Unlike previous authors, these authors find no association between
the MUC7 salivary protein and asthma. On the other hand, this
locus is associated with the oral microbiome. Furthermore, one
haplotype within this locus seems to have originated in an unknown
but deeply-divergent (superarchaic?) population, which
introgressed into the ancestors of modern Africans.</li>

<ul>
<li>How do scientists decide which species to focus on in
DNA-sequencing studies? This study shows that the most-studied
species are those for which there is a large prior literature and
that there is a bias in favor of species closely-related to our

patterns of population movement, interaction, and replacement in
sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here, we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan
African individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from
the DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the
contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer
populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with
incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic
environments. ... In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry
post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting
an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa."</li>

wild western lowland gorillas and sympatric central chimpanzees
and demonstrate compositional divergence between the microbiotas
of gorillas, chimpanzees, Old World monkeys, and modern humans. We
show that gorilla and chimpanzee microbiomes fluctuate with

reveal severe bottleneck among Asian hunter-gatherers following the
invention of agriculture.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Using genomic data, we show that for the majority of Asian
hunter-gatherers, population-sizes drastically decreased following
the invention of agriculture. We argue that a combination of
displacement, enslavement and disease resulted in the decimation
of hunter-gatherer societies."</li>

young adults predict longevity and reproductive lifespan.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The paper is the first report showing that differences in the
levels of mutation accumulation in young healthy adults predict
remaining lifespan in both sexes, and remaining reproductive span
in women. It is also the first report showing that mutation
accumulation accelerates in females after menarche, and it
presents data suggesting that mutation accumulation accelerates in
males after puberty as well. These results support two
long-standing theories about the nature of aging: 1) aging is due,
at least in part, to mutation accumulation in adults contributing
to cell and tissue dysfunction, onset of chronic diseases, and
ultimately death; and 2) aging begins in adolescence, possibly
triggered by puberty, consistent with the evolutionary biology
theory that the force of natural selection to maintain robust
health should begin to decline once the reproductive stage of life
is attained."</li>

<ul>
<li>"This analysis indicates that sled dogs represent an ancient
lineage going back at least 9500 years and that wolves bred with
the ancestors of sled dogs and precontact American dogs. However,
gene flow between sled dogs and wolves likely stopped before ∼9500
years ago."</li>

Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related

<ul>
<li>"We show that early in the middle Pleistocene, long before the
expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, the 'neandersovan'
ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans undertook a very similar
expansion. In both cases, an African population expanded into
Eurasia, endured a narrow bottleneck of population size, interbred
with indigeneous Eurasians, largely replaced them, and split into
eastern and western sub-populations. In the earlier expansion,
neandersovans interbred with a 'superarchaic' population that had
been separate since about 2 mya and may represent the original
expansion of humans into Eurasia."</li>

previously unexplained genetic diversity in African populations,
