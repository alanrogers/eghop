<h1>Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet weekly by Zoom.
<!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain time</a>-->
The summer session of the journal club has ended, and the fall session
will start in mid September. Before then, we'll run a Doodle poll to
find a convenient time. The poll will be announced via the eghop
google group. If you'd like to be part of that poll but are not yet a
member of the group, send email to Alan Rogers at the address below.</p>

<p>Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do so will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
(<a href="mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu">rogers@anthro.utah.edu</a>). Unless I
know you already, tell me about yourself. I'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.</p>

<h2>Suggested readings</h2>

<p>Click <a href="suggested.html">here</a> for the list of readings that have been
suggested for future meetings of the journal club. Use
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-CnDFiBVV5Zw_SR-CrBe5zYSijwkM1aiIqKeDjeQX2eRQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link</a> to suggest an article or preprint yourself. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Aug 03 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2">Ioannidis et al. 2020</a> Native American gene flow
into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement. Presenter: Alan
Rogers.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia." </li>

<li><p>Aug 10 <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170308v1.full?%3Fcollection=">Chakraborty et al. 2020.</a> Whole genomes
reveal severe bottleneck among Asian hunter-gatherers following the
invention of agriculture. Presenter: Saikat Chakraborty.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Using genomic data, we show that for the majority of Asian
hunter-gatherers, population-sizes drastically decreased following
the invention of agriculture. We argue that a combination of
displacement, enslavement and disease resulted in the decimation
of hunter-gatherer societies."</li>

<li><p>Aug 17 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaa140/5874945?fbclid=IwAR3FN-AN8t7pFfz3OMNrC_22JA1bzrLPqSQswSoWqMjhZz3T_P3mwANGWTw#.XxmB88-hF6o.facebook">Schlebusch et al. 2020</a> Khoe-San genomes reveal
unique variation and confirm the deepest population divergence in
<em>Homo sapiens</em>. Presenter: Carina Schlebusch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequenced 25 full genomes from Koe-San populations in southern
Africa. Find that Koe-San have more genetic diversity than any
other population and that 25% of variants are unique to Koe-San.
Evidence for selection at genes involved in immunity, the brain,
sperm, diet, and muscle. Evidence of a decline in population size
100,000 years ago.</li>
