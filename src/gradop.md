# Graduate training opportunities

This is a list of labs recruiting graduate students with an interest
in the evolutionary genetics of humans and other primates. To get your
own lab onto this list, send email to <rogers@anthro.utah.edu>.

1. Amy Goldberg <amy.goldberg@duke.edu>. We study population and
   evolutionary genetics of humans, our primate relatives, and our
   parasites. Current work includes demographic history of
   understudied human populations, primate immune genetics, and
   origins of malaria parasites. All positions will receive a stipend
   for the full PhD based on a mix of grant-funded RAships and
   potential TAships. More information available
   [here](https://www.goldberglab.org/join).

1. Austin Reynolds <austin_reynolds@baylor.edu>. Our lab uses genomic
   data from ancient and contemporary communities to answer questions
   about human population history and disease risk. Students will
   receive a stipend for the duration of their PhD through a
   combination of university funded RA- and TA-ships. Visit the lab
   [website](reynoldslab.org) for more information.

1. Alan Rogers <rogers@anthro.utah.edu>. We study human population
   genetics, with emphases on population history and adaptive
   evolution. Student support is through NSF grants and the
   department. To apply, click

1. Timothy Webster <timothy.h.webster@utah.edu>. Our lab uses genomic
   data and computational methods to understand primate evolution,
   ecology, and behavior. We are particularly interested in the
   processes responsible for generating and maintaining biological
   diversity. In particular, we explore (1) macroevolutionary
   processes, especially speciation, adaptation, and sex chromosome
   evolution, (2) modern and historical aspects of behavioral ecology
   and social organization, and (3) within-organism patterns of
   somatic variation related to development and disease. This involves
   both the development of software and methods, as well as the
   analysis of large, population genomic datasets. This work also
   spans variety of species, with current projects investigating
   humans, chimpanzees, macaques, lemurs, and tortoises. For more
