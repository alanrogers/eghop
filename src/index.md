# Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club

## Introduction

Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet weekly by Zoom. During the Fall
semester of 2020, we'll meet Mondays at noon
[Mountain time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone).

Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.

Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do so will be blocked.

If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
([rogers@anthro.utah.edu](mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu)). Unless I
know you already, tell me about yourself. I'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.

## Suggested readings

Click [here](suggested.html) for the list of readings that have been
suggested for future meetings of the journal club. Use
[this link][gform] to suggest an article or preprint yourself. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings.

## Schedule

* Sep 14 [Wang et al. 2020.][wang20:sa] Ancient genomes reveal complex
   patterns of population movement, interaction, and replacement in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Presenter: Ke Wang and Stephan Schiffels.

    * "Here, we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan
      African individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from
      the DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the
      contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer
      populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with
      incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic
      environments. ... In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry
      post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting
      an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa."

* Sep 21 [Gokhman, et al. 2019][gokhman20:cell] Reconstructing Denisovan
anatomy using DNA methylation maps. Presenter: David Gokhman.

  * "We present a method for reconstructing skeletal morphology using
  DNA methylation patterns. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared
  with Neanderthals traits such as an elongated face and a wide
  pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an
  increased dental arch and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions
  match the only morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date,
  as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a
  Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used to
  reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive
  in the fossil record."
