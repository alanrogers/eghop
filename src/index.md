# Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club

## Introduction

Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet weekly by Zoom. During the Spring
semester of 2021, we'll meet Tuesdays at 3PM
[Mountain time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone),
which is UTC-7 until March 14, then UTC-6.

Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.

Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do so will be blocked.

If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
([rogers@anthro.utah.edu](mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu)). Unless I
know you already, tell me about yourself. I'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.

## Suggested readings

Click [here](suggested.html) for the list of readings that have been
suggested for future meetings of the journal club. Use
[this link][gform] to suggest an article or preprint yourself. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings.

## Schedule

* Jan 26 [Jacobs et al 2019][jacobs19:cell] Multiple deeply divergent
  Denisovan ancestries in Papuans. Presenter: Alan Rogers.

  * "Modern Papuans carry hundreds of gene variants from two deeply
    divergent Denisovan lineages that separated over 350 thousand
    years ago. Spatial and temporal structure among these lineages
    suggest that introgression from one of these Denisovan groups
    predominantly took place east of the Wallace line and continued
    until near the end of the Pleistocene. A third Denisovan lineage
    occurs in modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests
    considerable complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans
    interbreeding with multiple Denisovan groups that were
    geographically isolated from each other over deep evolutionary
    time."
