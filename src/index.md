# Evolutionary Genetics of Humans and Other Primates: A Journal Club

## Introduction

Welcome to eghop, a journal club on the evolutionary genetics of
humans and other primates. We meet by Zoom *every Monday at 1 PM
[Mountain time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone)*.

Each week, we discuss a recent publication or preprint on the
evolutionary genetics of humans or other primates. Everyone is
welcome, from anywhere in the world. You need not be affiliated with
our University, and there is no fee. Undergraduates are welcome.  The
only prerequisite is an interest in the subject. The journal club is
administered by Alan Rogers and Tim Webster, of the University of
Utah.

Participants are expected to treat each other with respect. Anyone who
fails to do this will be blocked.

If you'd like to participate, send email to Alan Rogers
([rogers@anthro.utah.edu](mailto:rogers@anthro.utah.edu)). Unless we
know you already, tell us about yourself. We'll send you the Zoom
meeting id and password.

## Suggested readings

Please use [this link][gform] to suggest articles for discussion. We
prefer articles that present new findings--either empirical or
theoretical. Review papers and methodological papers are less likely
to provoke interesting discussions. We'll conduct surveys from time to
time to vote on the suggested readings. To see the current list of
suggested readings, click [here](suggested.html).

## Schedule

* May 25 [Skov et al 2020][skov20:nature] The nature of Neanderthal
  introgression revealed by 27,566 Icelandic genomes. Presenter: Alan
  Rogers. 

* Jun 01 [Rees, Castellano, and Andres. 2020.][rees20:trendsingenetics] The
   genomics of local adaptation. Presenter: Jasmin Rees.

* Jun 08 [Yu et al. 2020.][yu20:cell] Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians
   Reveal Connections with First Americans and across
   Eurasia. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * Nineteen Upper Paleolithic to Early Bronze Age genomes from the
      Lake Baikal region of Siberia. One Upper Paleolithic genome shares
      the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native
      Americans.

    * Populations of the Bronze Age in this region formed from those of
      the Neolithic by prolonged admixture.

    * Long-range human and Y. pestis mobility across Eurasia during the
      Early Bronze Age.

* Jun 15 [Amato et al. 2019][amato19:gb] Convergence of human and Old World
   monkey gut microbiomes demonstrates the importance of human ecology
   over phylogeny. Presenter: Katie Amato.

    * "Human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are
      more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World
      monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes." The
      microbiomes of humans are also more variable than those of other
      primates.

* Jun 22 [Musharoff, et al. 2019.][musharoff19:plosg] The inference of
   sex-biased human demography from whole-genome data. Presenter:
   Shaila Musharoff. 

    * X chromosomes and autosomes have different levels of genetic
      diversity because of their different population
      sizes. Furthermore, they respond differently to changes in
      population size, even in the absence of differences in male and
      female effective population sizes. These authors present a new
      method that simultaneously estimates changes in population size
      and in the ratio of male to female effective sizes. Finally, they
      apply the new method to several human populations.

* Jun 29 [Rogers, Harris, and Achenbach. 2020.][rogers20:sa]
   Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related
   hominin. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * "We show that early in the middle Pleistocene, long before the
    expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, the 'neandersovan'
    ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans undertook a very similar
    expansion. In both cases, an African population expanded into
    Eurasia, endured a narrow bottleneck of population size, interbred
    with indigeneous Eurasians, largely replaced them, and split into
    eastern and western sub-populations. In the earlier expansion,
    neandersovans interbred with a 'superarchaic' population that had
    been separate since about 2 mya and may represent the original
    expansion of humans into Eurasia."

* Jul 06 Two readings: (1) [Munung et al. 2017][munung17:plos1] Equity in
  international health research collaborations in Africa: Perceptions
  and expectations of African researchers, and (2)
  [Hoppe et al. 2019.][hoppe19:sa] Topic choice contributes to the
  lower rate of NIH awards to African-American/black
  scientists. Presenter: Tina Lasisi and Tim Webster. 

* Jul 13 [Henn, Steele, and Weaver. 2018.][henn20:cogd] Clarifying
  distinct models of modern human origins in Africa. Presenter:
  Brenna Henn.

    * "We describe four possible models for the origins of Homo sapiens
      in Africa based on published literature from paleoanthropology and
      human genetics. We briefly outline expectations for data patterns
      under each model, with a special focus on genetic data." 

* Jul 20 [Peter. 2020][peter20:biorxiv] 100,000 years of gene flow between
   Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains. Presenter:
   Benjamin Peter.

    * Studies gene flow between Neanderthals and Denisovans using a new
      method that can cope with degraded, low-coverage, DNA. Finds
      evidence of gene flow in both directions over a long period of
      time. But only in the Altai region of Siberia. European
      Neanderthals show no evidence of Denisovan admixture.

* Jul 27 [Cole et al. 2020.][cole20:biorxiv] Ancient admixture into
  Africa from the ancestors of non-Africans. Presenter: Chris Cole. 

    * "Here we present SMCSMC, a Bayesian method for inference of
      time-varying population sizes and directional migration rates
      under the coalescent-with-recombination model, to study ancient
      demographic events. We find evidence for substantial migration
      from the ancestors of present-day Eurasians into African groups
      between 40 and 70 thousand years ago, predating the divergence of
      Eastern and Western Eurasian lineages. This event accounts for
      previously unexplained genetic diversity in African populations,
      and supports the existence of novel population substructure in the
      Late Middle Paleolithic."

* Aug 03 [Ioannidis et al. 2020][ioannidis20:n] Native American gene flow
  into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement.

    * "Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
      islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
      analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
      Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
      for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
      American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
      settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
      strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
      Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
      individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
      the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia."
