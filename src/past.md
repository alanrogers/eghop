# Past discussion topics

## Summer 2020

* May 25 [Skov et al 2020][skov20:nature] The nature of Neanderthal
  introgression revealed by 27,566 Icelandic genomes. Presenter: Alan
  Rogers. 

* Jun 01 [Rees, Castellano, and Andres. 2020.][rees20:trendsingenetics] The
   genomics of local adaptation. Presenter: Jasmin Rees.

* Jun 08 [Yu et al. 2020.][yu20:cell] Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians
   Reveal Connections with First Americans and across
   Eurasia. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * Nineteen Upper Paleolithic to Early Bronze Age genomes from the
      Lake Baikal region of Siberia. One Upper Paleolithic genome shares
      the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native
      Americans.

    * Populations of the Bronze Age in this region formed from those of
      the Neolithic by prolonged admixture.

    * Long-range human and Y. pestis mobility across Eurasia during the
      Early Bronze Age.

* Jun 15 [Amato et al. 2019][amato19:gb] Convergence of human and Old World
   monkey gut microbiomes demonstrates the importance of human ecology
   over phylogeny. Presenter: Katie Amato.

    * "Human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are
      more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World
      monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes." The
      microbiomes of humans are also more variable than those of other
      primates.

* Jun 22 [Musharoff, et al. 2019.][musharoff19:plosg] The inference of
   sex-biased human demography from whole-genome data. Presenter:
   Shaila Musharoff. 

    * X chromosomes and autosomes have different levels of genetic
      diversity because of their different population
      sizes. Furthermore, they respond differently to changes in
      population size, even in the absence of differences in male and
      female effective population sizes. These authors present a new
      method that simultaneously estimates changes in population size
      and in the ratio of male to female effective sizes. Finally, they
      apply the new method to several human populations.

* Jun 29 [Rogers, Harris, and Achenbach. 2020.][rogers20:sa]
   Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related
   hominin. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * "We show that early in the middle Pleistocene, long before the
    expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, the 'neandersovan'
    ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans undertook a very similar
    expansion. In both cases, an African population expanded into
    Eurasia, endured a narrow bottleneck of population size, interbred
    with indigeneous Eurasians, largely replaced them, and split into
    eastern and western sub-populations. In the earlier expansion,
    neandersovans interbred with a 'superarchaic' population that had
    been separate since about 2 mya and may represent the original
    expansion of humans into Eurasia."

* Jul 06 Two readings: (1) [Munung et al. 2017][munung17:plos1] Equity in
  international health research collaborations in Africa: Perceptions
  and expectations of African researchers, and (2)
  [Hoppe et al. 2019.][hoppe19:sa] Topic choice contributes to the
  lower rate of NIH awards to African-American/black
  scientists. Presenter: Tina Lasisi and Tim Webster. 

* Jul 13 [Henn, Steele, and Weaver. 2018.][henn20:cogd] Clarifying
  distinct models of modern human origins in Africa. Presenter:
  Brenna Henn.

    * "We describe four possible models for the origins of Homo sapiens
      in Africa based on published literature from paleoanthropology and
      human genetics. We briefly outline expectations for data patterns
      under each model, with a special focus on genetic data." 

* Jul 20 [Peter. 2020][peter20:biorxiv] 100,000 years of gene flow between
   Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains. Presenter:
   Benjamin Peter.

    * Studies gene flow between Neanderthals and Denisovans using a new
      method that can cope with degraded, low-coverage, DNA. Finds
      evidence of gene flow in both directions over a long period of
      time. But only in the Altai region of Siberia. European
      Neanderthals show no evidence of Denisovan admixture.

* Jul 27 [Cole et al. 2020.][cole20:biorxiv] Ancient admixture into
  Africa from the ancestors of non-Africans. Presenter: Chris Cole. 

    * "Here we present SMCSMC, a Bayesian method for inference of
      time-varying population sizes and directional migration rates
      under the coalescent-with-recombination model, to study ancient
      demographic events. We find evidence for substantial migration
      from the ancestors of present-day Eurasians into African groups
      between 40 and 70 thousand years ago, predating the divergence of
      Eastern and Western Eurasian lineages. This event accounts for
      previously unexplained genetic diversity in African populations,
      and supports the existence of novel population substructure in the
      Late Middle Paleolithic."

* Aug 03 [Ioannidis et al. 2020][ioannidis20:n] Native American gene flow
  into Polynesia predating Easter Island settlement. Presenter: Alan
  Rogers.

    * "Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from
      islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture,
      analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15
      Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence
      for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native
      American individuals (around ad 1200) contemporaneous with the
      settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest
      strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern
      Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian
      individuals and a Native American group most closely related to
      the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia." 


* Aug 10 [Chakraborty et al. 2020.][chakraborty20:biorxiv] Whole genomes
  reveal severe bottleneck among Asian hunter-gatherers following the
  invention of agriculture. Presenter: Saikat Chakraborty.

    * "Using genomic data, we show that for the majority of Asian
      hunter-gatherers, population-sizes drastically decreased following
      the invention of agriculture. We argue that a combination of
      displacement, enslavement and disease resulted in the decimation
      of hunter-gatherer societies."

* Aug 17 [Schlebusch et al. 2020][schlebusch10:mbe] Khoe-San genomes reveal
   unique variation and confirm the deepest population divergence in
   *Homo sapiens*. Presenter: Carina Schlebusch.

    * Sequenced 25 full genomes from Koe-San populations in southern
      Africa. Find that Koe-San have more genetic diversity than any
      other population and that 25% of variants are unique to Koe-San.
      Evidence for selection at genes involved in immunity, the brain,
      sperm, diet, and muscle. Evidence of a decline in population size
      100,000 years ago.

## Fall 2020

* Sep 14 [Wang et al. 2020.][wang20:sa] Ancient genomes reveal complex
   patterns of population movement, interaction, and replacement in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Presenter: Ke Wang and Stephan Schiffels.

    * "We report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan African
      individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from the
      DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the
      contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer
      populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with
      incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic
      environments. ... In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry
      post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers,
      suggesting an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to
      southern Africa."

* Sep 21 [Gokhman, et al. 2019][gokhman20:cell] Reconstructing Denisovan
anatomy using DNA methylation maps. Presenter: David Gokhman.

  * "We present a method for reconstructing skeletal morphology using
  DNA methylation patterns. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared
  with Neanderthals traits such as an elongated face and a wide
  pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an
  increased dental arch and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions
  match the only morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date,
  as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a
  Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used to
  reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive
  in the fossil record."

* Sep 28 [Bergstrom et al. 2020][bergstrom20:s] Insights into human genetic
   variation and population history from 929 diverse
   genomes. Presenter: Anders Bergstrom.

   * A study of 929 high coverage genomes from 54 diverse populations.
   "Populations in central and southern Africa, the Americas, and
   Oceania each harbor tens to hundreds of thousands of private,
   common genetic variants. Most of these variants arose as new
   mutations rather than through archaic introgression, except in
   Oceanian populations, where many private variants derive from
   Denisovan admixture. ... We estimate that the genetic separation
   between present-day human populations occurred mostly within the
   past 250,000 years. However, these early separations were gradual
   in nature and shaped by protracted gene flow. ... Most populations
   expanded in size over the past 10,000 years, but hunter-gatherer
   groups did not. ... The low diversity among the Neanderthal
   haplotypes segregating in present-day populations indicates that,
   while more than one Neanderthal individual must have contributed
   genetic material to modern humans, there was likely only one major
   episode of admixture. By contrast, Denisovan haplotype diversity
   reflects a more complex history involving more than one episode of
   admixture."

* Oct 05 [O'Toole, Hurst, and McLysaught. 2018][otoole18:mbe] Faster
  evolving primate genes are more likely to duplicate. Presenter: Alan
  Rogers with Laurence Hurst.

 * "An attractive and long-standing hypothesis regarding the evolution
   of genes after duplication posits that the duplication event
   creates new evolutionary possibilities by releasing a copy of the
   gene from constraint. Apparent support was found in numerous
   analyses, particularly, the observation of higher rates of
   evolution in duplicated as compared with singleton genes. Could it,
   instead, be that more duplicable genes (owing to mutation,
   fixation, or retention biases) are intrinsically faster evolving?
   To uncouple the measurement of rates of evolution from the
   determination of duplicate or singleton status, we measure the
   rates of evolution in singleton genes in outgroup primate lineages
   but classify these genes as to whether they have duplicated or not
   in a crown group of great apes. We find that rates of evolution are
   higher in duplicable genes prior to the duplication event. In part
   this is owing to a negative correlation between coding sequence
   length and rate of evolution, coupled with a bias toward smaller
   genes being more duplicable. The effect is masked by difference in
   expression rate between duplicable genes and
   singletons. Additionally, in contradiction to the classical
   assumption, we find no convincing evidence for an increase in dN/dS
   after duplication, nor for rate asymmetry between duplicates. We
   conclude that high rates of evolution of duplicated genes are not
   solely a consequence of the duplication event, but are rather a
   predictor of duplicability. These results are consistent with a
   model in which successful gene duplication events in mammals are
   skewed toward events of minimal phenotypic impact."

* Oct 12 [Rinker et al. 2020][rinker20:nee] Neanderthal introgression
   reintroduced functional ancestral alleles lost in Eurasian
   populations. Presenter: Tony Capra. If you have trouble getting
   access to this paper, try the
   [version][rinker20:biorxiv]
   on bioRxiv.

    * "Our study reveals that Neanderthal introgression reintroduced
      thousands of lost ancestral variants with gene regulatory activity
      and that these RAs [reintroduced alleles] were more tolerated than
      NDAs [Neanderthal-derived alleles]. Thus, RAs and their distinct
      evolutionary histories must be considered when evaluating the
      effects of introgression."

* Oct 19 [Porubsky et al. 2020][porubsky20:ng] Recurrent inversion toggling
  and great ape genome evolution. Presenter: David Porubsky.

  * "the X chromosome is most enriched (2.5-fold) for inversions, on
    the basis of its size and duplication content. There is an excess
    of differentially expressed primate genes near the breakpoints of
    large (>100 kilobases (kb)) inversions but not smaller events. We
    show that when great ape lineage-specific duplications emerge,
    they preferentially (approximately 75%) occur in an inverted
    orientation compared to that at their ancestral locus. We
    construct megabase-pair scale haplotypes for individual
    chromosomes and identify 23 genomic regions that have recurrently
    toggled between a direct and an inverted state over 15 million
    years. The direct orientation is most frequently the derived state
    for human polymorphisms that predispose to recurrent copy number
    variants associated with neurodevelopmental disease." 

* Oct 26 [Hubisz, Williams, and Siepel. 2020][hubisz20:plog] Mapping gene
   flow between ancient hominins through demography-aware inference of
   the ancestral recombination graph. Presenter: Melissa Hubisz

  * "We present a major extension of the ARGweaver algorithm, called
    ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a
    user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and
    migration events. ... We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome
    that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate
    that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no
    convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these
    regions. Finally, we predict that 1% of the Denisovan genome was
    introgressed from an unsequenced, but highly diverged, archaic
    hominin ancestor. About 15% of these “super-archaic”
    regions—comprising at least about 4Mb—were, in turn, introgressed
    into modern humans and continue to exist in the genomes of people
    alive today." 

* Nov 02 [Galtier and Rouselle. 2020][galtier20:g];
  [bioRxiv version][galtier20:biorxiv];
  [PCI Evol Biol recommendation][galtier20:PCIEvolBiol]. How much does
  Ne vary among species?  Presenter: Nicolas Galtier

  * "We assess the magnitude of variation in drift power among species
    of animals via its effect on the mutation load. ... We estimate
    that the power of drift varies by a factor of at least 500 between
    large-Ne and small-Ne species of animals, i.e., an order of
    magnitude more than the among-species variation in genetic
    diversity."

* Nov 09 Cancelled

* Nov 16 [Tashkent et al. 2020][tashkent20:g] Analysis of haplotypic
   variation and deletion polymorphisms point to multiple archaic
   introgression events, including from Altai Neanderthal
   lineage. Presenters: Omer Gokcumen and Ozgur Taskent.

  * "We present a comprehensive analysis of the unusually divergent
    haplotypes in the Eurasian genomes and show that they can be
    traced back to multiple introgression events. In parallel, we
    document hundreds of deletion polymorphisms shared with
    Neanderthals. A locus-specific analysis of one such shared
    deletion suggests the existence of a direct introgression event
    from the Altai Neanderthal lineage into the ancestors of extant
    East Asian populations."

* Nov 23 Cancelled

* Nov 30 [Petr et al. 2020][petr20:science] [bioRxiv][petr20:biorxiv]
   The evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y
   chromosomes. Presenters: Martin Petr and Janet Kelso.

  * "We find that the Denisovan Y chromosomes split around 700
    thousand years ago (kya) from a lineage shared by Neandertal and
    modern human Y chromosomes, which diverged from each other around
    370 kya. The phylogenetic relationships of archaic and modern
    human Y chromosomes therefore differ from population relationships
    inferred from their autosomal genomes, and mirror the
    relationships observed on the level of mitochondrial DNA. This
    provides strong evidence that gene flow from an early lineage
    related to modern humans resulted in the replacement of both the
    mitochondrial and Y chromosomal gene pools in late
    Neandertals. Although unlikely under neutrality, we show that this
    replacement is plausible if the low effective population size of
    Neandertals resulted in an increased genetic load in their Y
    chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA relative to modern humans." 

* Dec 07 [Margaryan et al. 2020][margaryan20:n] Population genomics of the
   Viking world. Presenter: Ashot Margaryan.

  * "The maritime expansion of Scandinavian populations during the
    Viking Age (about ad 750–1050) was a far-flung transformation in
    world history1,2. Here we sequenced the genomes of 442 humans from
    archaeological sites across Europe and Greenland (to a median
    depth of about 1×) to understand the global influence of this
    expansion. We find the Viking period involved gene flow into
    Scandinavia from the south and east. We observe genetic structure
    within Scandinavia, with diversity hotspots in the south and
    restricted gene flow within Scandinavia. We find evidence for a
    major influx of Danish ancestry into England; a Swedish influx
    into the Baltic; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and
    Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial ancestry from
    elsewhere in Europe entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age."
