# Past discussion topics

* May 25 [Skov et al 2020][skov20:nature] The nature of Neanderthal
  introgression revealed by 27,566 Icelandic genomes. Presenter: Alan
  Rogers. 

* Jun 01 [Rees, Castellano, and Andres. 2020.][rees20:trendsingenetics] The
   genomics of local adaptation. Presenter: Jasmin Rees.

* Jun 08 [Yu et al. 2020.][yu20:cell] Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians
   Reveal Connections with First Americans and across
   Eurasia. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * Nineteen Upper Paleolithic to Early Bronze Age genomes from the
      Lake Baikal region of Siberia. One Upper Paleolithic genome shares
      the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native
      Americans.

    * Populations of the Bronze Age in this region formed from those of
      the Neolithic by prolonged admixture.

    * Long-range human and Y. pestis mobility across Eurasia during the
      Early Bronze Age.

* Jun 15 [Amato et al. 2019][amato19:gb] Convergence of human and Old World
   monkey gut microbiomes demonstrates the importance of human ecology
   over phylogeny. Presenter: Katie Amato.

    * "Human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are
      more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World
      monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes." The
      microbiomes of humans are also more variable than those of other
      primates.

* Jun 22 [Musharoff, et al. 2019.][musharoff19:plosg] The inference of
   sex-biased human demography from whole-genome data. Presenter:
   Shaila Musharoff. 

    * X chromosomes and autosomes have different levels of genetic
      diversity because of their different population
      sizes. Furthermore, they respond differently to changes in
      population size, even in the absence of differences in male and
      female effective population sizes. These authors present a new
      method that simultaneously estimates changes in population size
      and in the ratio of male to female effective sizes. Finally, they
      apply the new method to several human populations.

* Jun 29 [Rogers, Harris, and Achenbach. 2020.][rogers20:sa]
   Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related
   hominin. Presenter: Alan Rogers

    * "We show that early in the middle Pleistocene, long before the
    expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, the 'neandersovan'
    ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans undertook a very similar
    expansion. In both cases, an African population expanded into
    Eurasia, endured a narrow bottleneck of population size, interbred
    with indigeneous Eurasians, largely replaced them, and split into
    eastern and western sub-populations. In the earlier expansion,
    neandersovans interbred with a 'superarchaic' population that had
    been separate since about 2 mya and may represent the original
    expansion of humans into Eurasia."

* Jul 06 Two readings: (1) [Munung et al. 2017][munung17:plos1] Equity in
  international health research collaborations in Africa: Perceptions
  and expectations of African researchers, and (2)
  [Hoppe et al. 2019.][hoppe19:sa] Topic choice contributes to the
  lower rate of NIH awards to African-American/black
  scientists. Presenter: Tina Lasisi and Tim Webster. 

* Jul 13 [Henn, Steele, and Weaver. 2018.][henn20:cogd] Clarifying
  distinct models of modern human origins in Africa. Presenter:
  Brenna Henn.

    * "We describe four possible models for the origins of Homo sapiens
      in Africa based on published literature from paleoanthropology and
      human genetics. We briefly outline expectations for data patterns
      under each model, with a special focus on genetic data." 

* Jul 20 [Peter. 2020][peter20:biorxiv] 100,000 years of gene flow between
   Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains. Presenter:
   Benjamin Peter.

    * Studies gene flow between Neanderthals and Denisovans using a new
      method that can cope with degraded, low-coverage, DNA. Finds
      evidence of gene flow in both directions over a long period of
      time. But only in the Altai region of Siberia. European
      Neanderthals show no evidence of Denisovan admixture.
