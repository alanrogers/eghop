1. [Hubisz, Williams, and Sieepel. 2020][hubisz20:plog] Mapping gene
   flow between ancient hominins through demography-aware inference of
   the ancestral recombination graph. 

1. [Wang et al. 2020.][wang20:sa] Ancient genomes reveal complex
   patterns of population movement, interaction, and replacement in
   sub-Saharan Africa.

    * "Here, we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan
      African individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from
      the DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the
      contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer
      populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with
      incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic
      environments. ... In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry
      post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting
      an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa."

1. [Rinker et al. 2020][rinker20:nee] Neanderthal introgression
   reintroduced functional ancestral alleles lost in Eurasian
   populations.

    * "Our study reveals that Neanderthal introgression reintroduced
      thousands of lost ancestral variants with gene regulatory activity
      and that these RAs [reintroduced alleles] were more tolerated than
      NDAs [Neanderthal-derived alleles]. Thus, RAs and their distinct
      evolutionary histories must be considered when evaluating the
      effects of introgression."

1. [Betti et al. 2020][betti20:n] Climate shaped how Neolithic
   farmers and European hunter-gatherers interacted after a major
   slowdown from 6,100 BCE to 4,500 BCE.

    * "We identify four axes of [European Neolithic] expansion and
       observe a slowdown along three axes when crossing the same
       climatic threshold. This threshold reflects the quality of the
       growing season, suggesting that Near Eastern crops might have
       struggled under more challenging climatic conditions. This same
       threshold also predicts the mixing of farmers and hunter-gatherers
       as estimated from ancient DNA, suggesting that unreliable yields
       in these regions might have favoured the contact between the two
       groups."

1. [Zeberg and Paabo. 2020][zeberg20:biorxiv] The major genetic risk
   factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neandertals.

    * "A recent genetic association study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020)
       identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for
       respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2. Recent data comprising 3,199
       hospitalized COVID-19 patients and controls reproduce this and
       find that it is the major genetic risk factor for severe
       SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (COVID-19 Host Genetics
       Initiative). Here, we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic
       segment of ~50 kb that is inherited from Neandertals and occurs at
       a frequency of ~30% in south Asia and ~8% in Europe."

1. [Schlebusch et al. 2020][schlebusch10:mbe] Khoe-San genomes reveal
   unique variation and confirm the deepest population divergence in
   *Homo sapiens*.

    * Sequenced 25 full genomes from Koe-San populations in southern
      Africa. Find that Koe-San have more genetic diversity than any
      other population and that 25% of variants are unique to Koe-San.
      Evidence for selection at genes involved in immunity, the brain,
      sperm, diet, and muscle. Evidence of a decline in population size
      100,000 years ago.

1. [Immel et al. 2019.][immel19:biorxiv] Neolithic genomes reveal a
   distinct ancient HLA allele pool and population transformation in
   Europe.

    * Studied 42 late-Neolithic genomes from the Wartenberg culture of
      Europe. A high percentage--40%--of their ancestry was from hunter
      gatherers, and their HLA alleles were unlike those of modern
      Europeans. The authors argue that their immune systems were
      specialized for defense against viruses.

1. [Zen, Huber, Davies, and Lohmuller, 2020][zen20:biorxiv] Greater
   strength of selection and higher proportion of beneficial amino
   acid changing mutations in humans compared to mice and Drosophila
   melanogaster.

    * "We use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the
      demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral
      population and estimate that at least 20% of nonsynonymous
      substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by
      positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous
      estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup
      species and ancestral population."

1. [Zeberg, et al. 2020.][zeberg20:mbe] The Neandertal Progesterone
  Receptor.

    * "The gene encoding the progesterone receptor (PGR) carries
      introgressed Neandertal haplotypes...[, which] have reached nearly
      20% frequency in non-Africans and have been associated with
      preterm birth...  Present-day carriers of the Neandertal
      haplotypes express higher levels of the receptor. In a cohort of
      present-day Britons, these carriers have more siblings, fewer
      miscarriages, and less bleeding during early pregnancy suggesting
      that the Neandertal progesterone receptor alleles promote
      fertility. This may explain their high frequency in modern human
      populations."

1. [Xu et al. 2017.][xu20:mbe] Archaic hominin introgression in Africa
  contributes to functional salivary MUC7 genetic variation.

    * Unlike previous authors, these authors find no association between
      the MUC7 salivary protein and asthma. On the other hand, this
      locus is associated with the oral microbiome. Furthermore, one
      haplotype within this locus seems to have originated in an unknown
      but deeply-divergent (superarchaic?) population, which
      introgressed into the ancestors of modern Africans.

1. [Hernandez, Shenk, and Perry. 2020][hernandez20:biorxiv] Factors
   influencing taxonomic unevenness in scientific research: A
   mixed-methods case study of non-human primate genomic sequence data
   generation.

    * How do scientists decide which species to focus on in
      DNA-sequencing studies? This study shows that the most-studied
      species are those for which there is a large prior literature and
      that there is a bias in favor of species closely-related to our
      own.

1. [Hicks et al. 2018.][hicks20:nc] Gut microbiomes of wild great apes
   fluctuate seasonally in response to diet.

    * "Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbiota of
      wild western lowland gorillas and sympatric central chimpanzees
      and demonstrate compositional divergence between the microbiotas
      of gorillas, chimpanzees, Old World monkeys, and modern humans. We
      show that gorilla and chimpanzee microbiomes fluctuate with
      seasonal rainfall patterns and frugivory."

1. [Cawthon et al. 2020.][cawthon20:sr] Germline mutation rates in
   young adults predict longevity and reproductive lifespan.

    * "The paper is the first report showing that differences in the
      levels of mutation accumulation in young healthy adults predict
      remaining lifespan in both sexes, and remaining reproductive span
      in women. It is also the first report showing that mutation
      accumulation accelerates in females after menarche, and it
      presents data suggesting that mutation accumulation accelerates in
      males after puberty as well. These results support two
      long-standing theories about the nature of aging: 1) aging is due,
      at least in part, to mutation accumulation in adults contributing
      to cell and tissue dysfunction, onset of chronic diseases, and
      ultimately death; and 2) aging begins in adolescence, possibly
      triggered by puberty, consistent with the evolutionary biology
      theory that the force of natural selection to maintain robust
      health should begin to decline once the reproductive stage of life
      is attained."

1. [Sinding et al. 2020.][sinding20:s] Arctic-adapted dogs emerged at
   the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

    * "This analysis indicates that sled dogs represent an ancient
      lineage going back at least 9500 years and that wolves bred with
      the ancestors of sled dogs and precontact American dogs. However,
      gene flow between sled dogs and wolves likely stopped before âˆ¼9500
      years ago."
