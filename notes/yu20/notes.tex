  We also investigated their genetic composition using qpAdm modeling
  and found that both UKY and Kolyma possessed a similar level of ANE
  contribution, around 30\%, when modeled as two-way mixture of
  Devil's Gate (representing NEA ancestry) and AG3 (representing ANE
  ancestry) This model did not fit well for both UKY (p = 1.45E-03)
  and Kolyma (p = 3.98E-08), as the Native American Karitiana
  population showed extra affinity with the tested individuals
  compared to the fitted model (Table S3). This observation suggests
  that UKY and Kolyma shared a certain degree of genetic drift with
  Native American populations that occurred after the ancestors of
  Native Americans diverged from ANE and NEA ancestries.

  As the model didn't fit, the authors should have searched for one
  that did. Not a good idea to interpret a model that doesn't fit.

I wonder whether linguists have questions about this region. It would
have been interesting to involve a linguist.
