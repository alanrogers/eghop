Neolithic Wartberg grave community reveals distinct HLA variation
and hunter-gatherer ancestry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Studied 42 late-Neolithic genomes from the Wartenberg culture of
Europe. A high percentage--40%--of their ancestry was from hunter
gatherers, and their HLA alleles were unlike those of modern
Europeans. The authors argue that their immune systems were
specialized for defense against viruses.</li>

of cytokine production capacity in ancient and modern European
populations. </p>

<ul>
<li>"We observed that the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point
for immune-mediated traits in Europeans, favoring those alleles
linked with the development of tolerance against intracellular
pathogens and promoting inflammatory responses against
extracellular microbes." </li>

nature of the evolution of Homo sapiens. </p>

<ul>
<li>These authors summarize published data on the time of origin of
high-frequency alleles in several categories: those under positive
selection, those introgressed from archaics, and regulatory genes
active in the brain. Several of these age distributions are
bimodal, with one mode at 300-500 kya.</li>

Bronze Age transition in the East European plain.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The transition from Stone to Bronze Age in Central and Western
Europe was a period of major population movements originating from
the Ponto-Caspian Steppe. Here, we report new genome-wide sequence
data from 30 individuals north of this area, from the understudied
western part of present-day Russia, including 3 Stone Age
hunter-gatherers (10,800 to 4250 cal BCE) and 26 Bronze Age
farmers from the Corded Ware complex Fatyanovo Culture (2900 to
2050 cal BCE). We show that Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry was
present in northwestern Russia already from around 10,000
BCE. Furthermore, we see a change in ancestry with the arrival of
farming—Fatyanovo Culture individuals were genetically similar to
other Corded Ware cultures, carrying a mixture of Steppe and
European early farmer ancestry. Thus, they likely originate from a
fast migration toward the northeast from somewhere near modern-day
Ukraine—the closest area where these ancestries coexisted from
around 3000 BCE."</li>

on population differentiation: a study with HLA genes.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Theory predicts that balancing selection reduces population
differentiation, as measured by FST...However, in pairs of closely
related populations, where genome-wide differentiation is low,
differentiation at HLA is higher than in other genomic
regions. Such increased population differentiation at HLA genes
for recently diverged population pairs was reproduced in
simulations of overdominant selection, as long as the fitness of
the homozygotes differs between the diverging populations."</li>

flexibility, large brains, and long lives: capuchin monkey genomics
revealed with fecalFACS.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We compared genomes of capuchin populations from tropical dry
forests and lowland rainforests and identified population
divergence in genes involved in water balance, kidney function,
and metabolism. Through a comparative genomics approach spanning a
wide diversity of mammals, we identified genes under positive
selection associated with longevity and brain development."</li>

endangered Dryas monkey provides new insights into the evolutionary
history of the Vervets.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We show that the [endangered] Dryas monkey represents a sister
lineage to the vervets (Chlorocebus sp.) and has diverged from
them ∼1.4 Ma with additional bidirectional gene flow
∼750,000–500,000 years ago that has likely involved the crossing
of the Congo River. ... We find high genetic diversity and low
levels of inbreeding and genetic load in the studied Dryas monkey
individual. This suggests that the current population carries
sufficient genetic variability for long-term survival and might be
larger than currently recognized."</li>

farmers and European hunter-gatherers interacted after a major
slowdown from 6,100 BCE to 4,500 BCE.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We identify four axes of [European Neolithic] expansion and
observe a slowdown along three axes when crossing the same
climatic threshold. This threshold reflects the quality of the
growing season, suggesting that Near Eastern crops might have
struggled under more challenging climatic conditions. This same
threshold also predicts the mixing of farmers and hunter-gatherers
as estimated from ancient DNA, suggesting that unreliable yields
in these regions might have favoured the contact between the two
groups."</li>

<ul>
<li>"We present a high-quality de novo genome assembly (rheMacS) of
the Chinese rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using long-read
sequencing and multiplatform scaffolding approaches. Compared to
the current Indian rhesus macaque reference genome (rheMac8),
rheMacS increases sequence contiguity 75-fold, closing 21,940 of
the remaining assembly gaps (60.8 Mbp). We improve gene annotation
by generating more than two million full-length transcripts from
ten different tissues by long-read RNA sequencing. We sequence
resolve 53,916 structural variants (96% novel) and identify 17,000
ape-specific structural variants (ASSVs) based on comparison to
ape genomes." </li>

acid changing mutations in humans compared to mice and Drosophila

<ul>
<li>"We use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the
demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral
population and estimate that at least 20% of nonsynonymous
substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by
positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous
estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup
species and ancestral population."</li>

population structure and history of the Dutch population. "Despite
superexponential population growth, regional demographic estimates

structure in the golden-crowned sifaka.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We observe high excess of heterozygotes within
[social groups (SGs)]. ... While offspring are characterised by a
high excess of heterozygotes (FIS &lt; 0), the reproductive pair does
not show dramatic departures from Hardy–Weinberg
expectations. Moreover, the heterozygosity excess disappears at
larger geographic scales (sites and forests). ... Our results
suggest that social structure leads to high levels of outbreeding
without the need for active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms."</li>

factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neandertals.</p>

<ul>
<li>"A recent genetic association study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020)
identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for
respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2. Recent data comprising 3,199
hospitalized COVID-19 patients and controls reproduce this and
find that it is the major genetic risk factor for severe
SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (COVID-19 Host Genetics
Initiative). Here, we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic
segment of ~50 kb that is inherited from Neandertals and occurs at
a frequency of ~30% in south Asia and ~8% in Europe."</li>

Receptor.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The gene encoding the progesterone receptor (PGR) carries
introgressed Neandertal haplotypes...[, which] have reached nearly
20% frequency in non-Africans and have been associated with
preterm birth...  Present-day carriers of the Neandertal
haplotypes express higher levels of the receptor. In a cohort of
present-day Britons, these carriers have more siblings, fewer
miscarriages, and less bleeding during early pregnancy suggesting
that the Neandertal progesterone receptor alleles promote
fertility. This may explain their high frequency in modern human
populations."</li>

<ul>
<li>"We generated genome-wide ancient-DNA data from the Balearic
Islands, Sicily and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals
with reported data from 5 to 66. The oldest individual from the
Balearic Islands (~2400 bc) carried ancestry from steppe
pastoralists that probably derived from west-to-east migration from
Iberia, although two later Balearic individuals had less ancestry
from steppe pastoralists. In Sicily, steppe pastoralist ancestry
arrived by ~2200 bc. ... Major immigration into Sardinia began in
the first millennium bc and, at present, no more than 56–62% of
Sardinian ancestry is from its first farmers. This value is lower
than previous estimates, highlighting that Sardinia, similar to
every other region in Europe, has been a stage for major movement
and mixtures of people." </li>
