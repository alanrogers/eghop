Denisovan ancestries in Papuans.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Modern Papuans carry hundreds of gene variants from two deeply
divergent Denisovan lineages that separated over 350 thousand
years ago. Spatial and temporal structure among these lineages
suggest that introgression from one of these Denisovan groups
predominantly took place east of the Wallace line and continued
until near the end of the Pleistocene. A third Denisovan lineage
occurs in modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests
considerable complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans
interbreeding with multiple Denisovan groups that were
geographically isolated from each other over deep evolutionary
time."</li>

<li>These authors summarize published data on the time of origin of
high-frequency alleles in several categories: those under positive

active in the brain. Several of these age distributions are

Bronze Age transition in the East European plain.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The transition from Stone to Bronze Age in Central and Western
Europe was a period of major population movements originating from
the Ponto-Caspian Steppe. Here, we report new genome-wide sequence
data from 30 individuals north of this area, from the understudied
western part of present-day Russia, including 3 Stone Age
hunter-gatherers (10,800 to 4250 cal BCE) and 26 Bronze Age
farmers from the Corded Ware complex Fatyanovo Culture (2900 to
2050 cal BCE). We show that Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry was
present in northwestern Russia already from around 10,000
BCE. Furthermore, we see a change in ancestry with the arrival of
farming—Fatyanovo Culture individuals were genetically similar to
other Corded Ware cultures, carrying a mixture of Steppe and
European early farmer ancestry. Thus, they likely originate from a
fast migration toward the northeast from somewhere near modern-day
Ukraine—the closest area where these ancestries coexisted from
around 3000 BCE."</li>

on population differentiation: a study with HLA genes.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Theory predicts that balancing selection reduces population
differentiation, as measured by FST...However, in pairs of closely
related populations, where genome-wide differentiation is low,
differentiation at HLA is higher than in other genomic
regions. Such increased population differentiation at HLA genes
for recently diverged population pairs was reproduced in
simulations of overdominant selection, as long as the fitness of
the homozygotes differs between the diverging populations."</li>

human pre-eclampsia risk during convergent evolution of reduced
placental invasiveness in eutherian mammals. (Should we exclude
this paper on the basis of its age?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-eclampsia is a disease of human pregnancy that results from
reduced invasiveness of the placenta. These authors study the
evolution of reduced placental invasiveness in 18 species of
mammal and find effects on 1254 genes. Of these, 199 seem to be
the targets of natural selection during evolutionary change in
placental invasiveness. These genes may also underlie human
placental disorders.</li>

<ul>
<li>"We compared genomes of capuchin populations from tropical dry

<ul>
<li>"H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, and H. neanderthalensis, lost a
significant portion of their climatic niche space just before
extinction, with no corresponding reduction in physical
range. This reduction coincides with increased vulnerability to
climate change. In the case of Neanderthals, the increased
extinction risk was probably exacerbated by competition with
H. sapiens. This study suggests that climate change was the
primary factor in the extinction of Homo species." </li>

endangered Dryas monkey provides new insights into the evolutionary
history of the Vervets.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We show that the [endangered] Dryas monkey represents a sister
lineage to the vervets (Chlorocebus sp.) and has diverged from
them ∼1.4 Ma with additional bidirectional gene flow
∼750,000–500,000 years ago that has likely involved the crossing
of the Congo River. ... We find high genetic diversity and low
levels of inbreeding and genetic load in the studied Dryas monkey
individual. This suggests that the current population carries
sufficient genetic variability for long-term survival and might be
larger than currently recognized."</li>

farmers and European hunter-gatherers interacted after a major
slowdown from 6,100 BCE to 4,500 BCE.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We identify four axes of [European Neolithic] expansion and
observe a slowdown along three axes when crossing the same
climatic threshold. This threshold reflects the quality of the
growing season, suggesting that Near Eastern crops might have
struggled under more challenging climatic conditions. This same
threshold also predicts the mixing of farmers and hunter-gatherers
as estimated from ancient DNA, suggesting that unreliable yields
in these regions might have favoured the contact between the two
groups."</li>

recessive mutations and the role of standing genetic variation.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Expanding populations incur a mutation burden--the so‐called
expansion load. ... [We find that] the loss of deleterious mutations
at some loci is compensated by an increase of their frequencies at
other loci. The frequency of deleterious homozygotes therefore
increases along the expansion axis, whereas the average number of
deleterious mutations per individual remains nearly constant across
the species range."</li>

<li>"We found that 17 genes in the mandrill that have been associated
with disease phenotypes in human such as Lung cancer, cranial
volume and asthma, barbored amino acids changing mutations. Gene
family analyses revealed expansion of several genes, and several
genes associated with stress environmental adaptation and innate
immunity responses exhibited signatures of positive selection. In

the Chinese rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using long-read
sequencing and multiplatform scaffolding approaches. Compared to
the current Indian rhesus macaque reference genome (rheMac8),
rheMacS increases sequence contiguity 75-fold, closing 21,940 of
the remaining assembly gaps (60.8 Mbp). We improve gene annotation
by generating more than two million full-length transcripts from
ten different tissues by long-read RNA sequencing. We sequence
resolve 53,916 structural variants (96% novel) and identify 17,000
ape-specific structural variants (ASSVs) based on comparison to

<li>Studied 42 late-Neolithic genomes from the Wartenberg culture of

[social groups (SGs)]. ... While offspring are characterised by a
high excess of heterozygotes (FIS &lt; 0), the reproductive pair does
not show dramatic departures from Hardy–Weinberg

larger geographic scales (sites and forests). ... Our results

haplotypes express higher levels of the receptor. In a cohort of

young adults predict longevity and reproductive lifespan.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The paper is the first report showing that differences in the
levels of mutation accumulation in young healthy adults predict
remaining lifespan in both sexes, and remaining reproductive span
in women. It is also the first report showing that mutation
accumulation accelerates in females after menarche, and it
presents data suggesting that mutation accumulation accelerates in
males after puberty as well. These results support two
long-standing theories about the nature of aging: 1) aging is due,
at least in part, to mutation accumulation in adults contributing
to cell and tissue dysfunction, onset of chronic diseases, and
ultimately death; and 2) aging begins in adolescence, possibly
triggered by puberty, consistent with the evolutionary biology
theory that the force of natural selection to maintain robust
health should begin to decline once the reproductive stage of life
is attained."</li>

from steppe pastoralists. In Sicily, steppe pastoralist ancestry
arrived by ~2200 bc. ... Major immigration into Sardinia began in
the first millennium bc and, at present, no more than 56–62% of
Sardinian ancestry is from its first farmers. This value is lower
than previous estimates, highlighting that Sardinia, similar to
every other region in Europe, has been a stage for major movement
